How To Create A New App
----

install tane

`gem install tane`

`bundle exec tane create`

You can optionally pass a project name value to the create command. If you don't it will ask you for one. The create command will then make a new directory using that passed name. The create command will use that directory to generate a new rails 3 app based of a Bushido app template.
